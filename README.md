# Team Profile Generator

## Description of Project
In almost every industry, having the ability to quickly generate a clean, easy-to-read team profile page to share with clients is imperative.  This application gives you that capability.  If an old team member leaves or a newbie joins, just run the application again and you'll be able to update it!

Once initiated, you will be led through a series of prompts to fill in employee data based on role.  After you have completed the prompts, your page will automatically generate!

## Takeaways
We keep expanding on our back-end programming capabilities as we head into units dedicated to writing server-based code.  The three primary takeaways from this project are:

- Improving upon command-line applications with Node.js
- Creating classes/subclasses with ES6 and using modularity to separate functionality
- Developing a series of unit tests that correlate with said classes
